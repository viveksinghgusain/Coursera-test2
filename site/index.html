Q: While typing in my password during an attempt to push files to GitHub, nothing is showing up while I type. What is going on?
A: Unlike most experiences we have while typing in a password, programs that run in the terminal behave a little differently. You are likely familiar with seeing asterisks printed in place of the letters you type for your password, be it while logging into your bank’s website or even your Coursera account. On the terminal, however, while you are typing your password, you will not see any characters show up on the screen. Even though you cannot see anything printed on the screen while typing it, type your entire password and hit the Enter key when done.Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant! Today’s user expects a lot out of the web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable to view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones.
<p>
In this course, we will learn the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. We will start from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance to learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user’s screen. You’ll be able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! Last but certainly not least, we will get a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, you will be able to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page?

	Be sure that you have included two necessary files in your HTML file BEFORE the inclusion of the Bootstrap JavaScript file. The two files needed are jquery.js and jquery-ui.js, and Bootstrap depends upon functions defined inside of them, for it to work properly.
